    Our website uses “Google Analytics” to collect information about the
    use of our site. Google Analytics collects information such as how
    often users visit our site, what pages they visit when they do so,
    and what other sites they used prior to coming to our site. We use
    the information we get from Google Analytics to improve our site.
    Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the
    date you visit our site, rather than your name or other identifying
    information. We do not combine the information collected through the
    use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.
    Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web
    browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our
    site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s
    ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics
    about your visits to our site is restricted by the Google Analytics
    Terms of Use.
